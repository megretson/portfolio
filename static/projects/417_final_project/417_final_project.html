    <p>
        This was our final project for computer animation. We wanted to make an animation about
        this past semester, but with a humorous take on the Covid pandemic. Our animation is about
        one of the only things that might be happy we're all trapped at home: a roomba.

    <h3>Storyboard and Description</h3>

    <p>
        The story starts with a frustrated Roomba. He has nothing to do. That is, until he hears something.
        He turns around to find a trash ball. He's excited, and sucks it up. But then he turns to find several more,
        leading out of the kitchen. He rounds the corner in the living room, and discovers a trash mountain. Looks
        like there's been some sort of netflix marathon. The final shot is of him caught in the trash, absolutely
        thrilled to be caught in the mess.

        The story ends with a freeze frame on the roomba, king of the trash hill.

    <h3>Models</h3>
    <p>
        This project has an ambitious number of models, including:
    <ul>
        <li>A refrigerator</li>
        <li>Cabinets</li>
        <li>A kitchen table</li>
        <li>A kitchen chairs</li>
        <li>A kitchen table</li>
        <li>Outlets</li>
        <li>A sofa</li>
        <li>A coffee table</li>
        <li>A TV</li>
        <li>Soda cans</li>
        <li>Pizza and a pizza box</li>
        <li>Trash balls, modeled using an nCloth</li>
        <li>And, of course, the roomba itself</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        All of the models were made by us.

    <h3>Principles of Animation</h3>

    <p>
        We used several principles of animation in this project. The first is
        <b>anticipation</b>. The roomba hits the wall, bouncing back each time. Until
        the ball of trash hits the floor. There's a delay, and then he turns around.
        He pauses before vacuuming up the trash, considering it.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second principle used was <b>staging</b>. When the animation starts, the
        roomba is not at the center of the screen. He is off to the side. This is
        intentional; when the trash drops it becomes clear the roomba wasn't the
        focus of the scene, the trash, which lands center at the corner of the fridge,
        was. Similarly, the TV scene is staged to place focus on the trash.
    </p>

    <p>
        The roomba's movement follows <b>slow-in slow-out</b>. He doesn't move at top
        speed right away. Instead, he takes a minute to get going, and builds speed
        before decelerating.
    </p>

    <p>
        The animation uses <b>squash and stretch</b>. The roomba's bumper is animated, so it
        takes inital impact, squishing against the roomba. Similarly, the first trash ball that
        falls squishes when it hits the ground, stretches when it bounces back.
    </p>

    <p>
        There's also a cute <b>secondary action</b> in the movement of the roomba. The spinning of
        the brushes as he moves adds to the personality of our main character. It doesn't distract
        from the animation, but just adds a little life to the roomba. This adds to the roomba's
        overall <b>appeal</b>. His little smile, and the overall soft cheery color palette of the
        animation, add to the animation's overall appeal.
