    </ul>
    <p>
        This was the fourth project, using Disney's 12 Principles of Animation to animate a roller coaster.
    </p>
    <h3>Storyline</h3>
    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
        The basic storyline is that its a roller coaster in a cute forest, and the camera tries to anticipate the movements.
    </p>
    <h3>Principles</h3>
    <p>
        There were three principles I used:
        <ul>
            <li>Anticipation</li>
            <li>Slow-in Slow-out</li>
            <li>Appeal</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Anticipation</b>
        <br>
        I keyed the camera to look at where the track is headed before it reaches it. I also had the car stall at a few
        critical moments, such as at the coaster's peak or on the loop.

    <p>
        <b>Slow-in Slow-Out</b>
        <br>
        As you can see from the graph editor I've included screenshots of, the car slowly gains velocity and slowly
        loses it.

    <p>
        <b>Appeal</b>
        <br>
        I spent more time than I should have building my forest. Originally, the camera was meant ot walk up to the
        platform through the forest, I just ran out of time to key two motion paths. The forest has little toadstools
        and what I am warmly calling "bubble trees"

    <p>
        <b>Arcs</b>
        <br>
        My coaster track is built entirely of CV curves, with a piece of track I created animation snap-shot-ed
        along the track and then bridges together. The coaster is meant to have nice gentle arcs.

        Check out the final product <a href="https://youtu.be/xjdYa6slLmI">here</a>. I improved my playblast settings
        over my last animations, but I have no idea how. It's probably because I had to uninstall and reinstall maya to
        complete this project, and there was some setting buried deep that was restored to a default. In other exciting
        news, this is the best animation I have ever made from quarantine.
