        This was the fifth project, animating a Rube Goldberg machine using Maya dynamics.

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        The basic idea is that this is a baking Rube Goldberg machine. The final product changed in several ways from the
        storyboard outline, that I will discuss with each of the objects. I placed my machine into a little kitchen
        because I thought it was cute.

    <h3>Objects</h3>

    <p>
        <b>(1) Lever and fulcrum, with (2) egg and (3) weight</b>
        <br>
        This is the start of the animation: a weight falls on a lever
        launching the egg into the bowl of the mixer. All of these components, except for the fulcrum, are active rigid
        bodies. The fulcrum is a passive rigid body. Getting the weight of each component right was a problem, but I'm
        satisfied with the ultimate result. As you might notice, this part of the machine is not as storyboarded.
        Originally, this was meant to be a pulley, and I modelled a complicated chain set-up for it. Ultimately my
        computer could not handle that many active rigid bodies interacting with each other; it crash and froze every
        time not matter what I did, hence the change.

    <p>
        <b>(4) Dominoes and (5) button</b>
        <br>
        The dominoes are hit by the weight, falling over onto a green button.
        The dominoes should have been simple and ended up being quite frustrating. As you can see in the final playblast,
        the dominoes kind of launch out of place. When I ran the simulation ONLY on the dominoes, this didn't happen. I
        have to chalk it up to one too many objects again. The button is key-framed, but is a passive rigid body.

    <p>
        <b>(6) Ramp with chocolate chips</b>
        <br>
        Once the button is pressed by the dominoes, this lowers the barrier to release my "chocolate chips" into the bowl.
        I modeled them as little chocolate balls because I liked the way they rolled better. In my final play blast one
        actually escapes before it can make it into the bowl ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>
        <b>(7) Mixer and (8) vanilla bottle </b>
        <br>
        The mixer spins on once the chocolate chips have been added and after the vanilla is added to the mix. I'm
        actually most proud of the mixer model; I did it by hand by creating cv curves that matched the curve of a
        Kitchenaid, then lofting them out along the x-axis and converting that to a solid polygon. Several hours of
        gentle fussing later, and I was satisfied with it's shape. I don't think it shows up super well in the final
        product, so I've included an image here.
