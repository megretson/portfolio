        This was the second project, modeling a treasure chest. I decided to model something slightly different, the
        Ark of the Covenant ala Indiana Jones.

        This took... forever. But the final product is accurate to the reference image.

        Some of the elements I did not model myself, such as the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:118125">
        decoration </a> on top of the box or the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3022253">topographical</a>
        map on the side of the box, or the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:135108">treasure</a> inside.

        To see the wireframes, scroll through the carousel on the left.

        Of course, my covenant needed treasure. A very important treasure. Treasure Nazis would *DIE* for. Thus,
        inside of my box you will find Manna from Heaven:

        Check out the final product at <a href="https://youtu.be/YS2IUz7lEZ4 ">here</a>. You may notice one ever so
        slight error on the box, but I fought with this for hours so I don't want to talk about it.
