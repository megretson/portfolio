    <span>My first project for CSCI 417: Computer Animation</span>
    <span>
        <b>
            Here is the initial tutorial project:
        </b>
    </span>
    <span>
        <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/389404444" width="640" height="500" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>    </span>
    <span>
        <b>
            This is the updated / expanded project:
        </b>
    </span>
    <span>
        <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/389405181" width="640" height="452" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </span>

    <p>The three modifications were: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Adding a background</li>
        <li>Changing the rotations on the planets so that they form a beautiful little spiral.</li>
        <li>Texturing the planets with actual images from the hubble space telescope.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        I also experimented with actually rendering the video, rather than just play-blasting it, only to discover an
        unsolved bug on maya on mac wherein output .qt files dissapear; but that’s neither here nor there. I’m
        satisfied with the aesthetic of my final project, although there are other features / tools I’m excited to
        actually learn how to use.
