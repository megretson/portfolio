        This was the sixth project, creating an animation in Maya using only Python scripting.

        This project is a little ode to Dungeons and Dragons. In the center is an icosahedron, or as players know it,
        a d20. Swirling around the d20 are all the other dice used to play DND; d4 (tetrahedron), d6 (cube),
        d8 (octahedron), and d12 (dodecahedron).

        The script is based on the python scripting tutorial found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXFGeZZbMzQ">here</a>.
        I added a few personal touches. The first was editing the shapes found in the tutorial to the dice shapes.
        There are an even number of each type of die based on the number of instances the user creates. Each die is given
        a random color by setting its shaders RGB value to a random set of three numbers. However, the script sets a random seed,
        so you'll need to change the seed to see the colors show up differently.
        The second was changing the spinning of the die, the d20 spins counter to the the die that swirl around it.
        They also rise up slightly through the animation, following the path of the d20.
         <br>
        I think this was actually my favorite project so far. There were tasks that were much easier to accomplish
        precisely in code than they were in the GUI.
