    </ul>
    <p>
        This was the third project, using Disney's 12 Principles of Animation to animate a bouncing ball.
    </p>
    <h3>Storyline</h3>
    <p>
        My storyline? Truly shakespearean. A story of betrayal. Meet our two characters, Pinky, a very good boy,
        and naughty, untrustworthy Golf.

    <p>
        The basic storyline is that Pinky out-bounces Golf. In a fit of jealous rage, Golf pushes Pinky from the table.
    </p>
    <h3>Principles</h3>
    <p>
        There were four (primary) principles I played with:
        <ul>
            <li>Squash and stretch</li>
            <li>Anticipation</li>
            <li>Staging</li>
            <li>Arcs</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Squash and stretch</b>
        <br>
        This one is pretty straight forward. I wanted to show a difference in our two characters based on how they deform on
        hitting the table. We "like" Pinky more because he feels more elastic and nice, while Golf does not deform much
        on hitting the table.

    <p>
        <b>Anticipation</b>
        <br>
        There are several moments of anticipation in the animation. A regret of mine is that I didn't stretch out the
        anticipation even further, but que sera. We have a moment of wondering: will Golf do it? What goes on in that
        round head of his? And then there is the moment when Golf looks back, over his shoulder, and we wonder: what is
        he looking at?

    <p>
        <b>Staging</b>
        <br>
        We love the rule of thirds. Here it is simple and effective. I also choose to have Pinky fly in so that he is
        partially out of frame, to make his reappearance more surprising.

    <p>
        <b>Arcs</b>
        <br>
        I spent a lot of time working in the graph editor for this project. Even though my balls don't move in an arc
        (it didn't fit well in the staging) the path of their y-axis movement is an arc. First a before:

    <p>
        And an after:

    <p>
        Check out the final product at <a href="https://youtu.be/Kyptb9ZKkl0">here</a>. I'm still fighting with rendering
        settings, but the quality is higher than it has been for any of my previous play-blasts. (Before you ask, yes
        my render settings are at 1080 HD, Maya just hates me. Why do women drag down other women?)
