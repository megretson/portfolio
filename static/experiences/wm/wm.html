    <p>For a full transcript of my time at William &amp; Mary, see
        <a href="/static/experiences/wm/WM_Academic_Transcript.pdf">here.</a> There you can admire all of the silly
        classes I took at William &amp; Mary, including Meditation and Millinery.
    </p>
    <p>
        At William &amp; Mary, I also lead our <a href="http://acm.cs.wm.edu/">ACM chapter</a> for two years as Chair, and
        for one year as <a href="http://cypher.cs.wm.edu/">hackathon chair.</a> ACM was my deepest and most meaningful
        involvement at William &amp; Mary. During my time as chair, I saw (and hope I fostered) a real change in the
        culture of the CS department at William &amp; Mary. It became a more welcoming and inclusive space. The classes
        were no less challenging, but ACM was responsible for deepening the connections between students and faculty,
        making those hard classes bearable. I also acted as a student perspective in departmental decisions, such as
        hiring new faculty and redesigning the McGlothlin Street Hall Computer Science Lab.

        During my time as Chair I also had a lot of fun. I also helped to plan tribeHacks IV, Cypher V, and Cypher VI
        William &amp; Mary’s annual hackathon attended by over 200 hackers, with an annual budget of over $20,000, but
        more importantly a yearly Costco run that requires four cars.
